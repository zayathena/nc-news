# Northcoders News API

I am building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as Reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

You will need to install npm and postgres.

The following files will need to be created to access to environment:
1. .env.development 
2. .env.test
